# Stop Go Gate
Automated stop-go gate for RC racing

The Stop Go Gate (SGG) is an automated system for implementing timed stop/go events for RC racing. It features a central control unit, 3-panel LED traffic light tower, entry/exit detectors and via an embedded 2.4GHz radio, support for an optional remote control and slave traffic lights.

A "gate area" is marked out with an entry and exit detector, which connect to the control unit via standard CAT-5 cables. When a vehicle enters the gate, the traffic light goes red to indicate they should wait, and after an adjustable time has elapsed, the traffic light will shown green, indicating that they may now proceed. The time is adjusted on the unit, as is the brightness of the LED panels.
